    <h2>Indian Spicy Mushroom Curry</h2>
    <p>
      Mushroom masala is a delicious Indian curry made with mushrooms, onions
      tomatoes, spices &amp: herbs. This mushroom masala is one of the best I
      have located online and I have made it regularly. It is quite simple to
      make &amp: tastes delicous.
    </p>
    <p>
      We love the restaurant style dishes with smooth &amp: rich gravy that are
      flavor packed.

    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>200 to 230 grams mushrooms sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup onions cubes (1 large)</li>
      <li>1 cup tomatoes cubes (2 large)</li>
      <li>1/2 inch ginger chopped</li>
      <li>12 cashwes or almonds</li>
      <li>2 tablesspoons oil or butter (I prefer ghee)</li>
      <li>3/4 to 1 teaspoon of garam masala</li>
      <li>1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder</li>
      <li>3.4 to 1 teaspoon coriander powder (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt or salt to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
      <li>2 to 3 cloves of garlic chopped</li>

      <h3>Optional</h3>

      <li>1 small bay leaf or 10 curry leaves</li>
      <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
      <li>2 tbsp coriander leaves</li>
      <li>2 to 3 tbsp cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Boil 2 cups of water in a pot. Add 1 cup onions and boil them for 6 to 7
        mins until transparent. Drain the water and add them to the blender.
        This step is done to remove the raw smell &amp: bitter taste from the
        onions.
      </li>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup tomatoes, ½ inch ginger, 2 to 3 garlic cloves and 12 cashew
        nuts to a blender jar. I did not have cashews so I used almonds here. If
        using almonds soak them in hot water for 30 mins and then peel the skin
        and add them. You can also replace ginger garlic with 1 tsp ginger
        garlic paste.
      </li>
      <li>Puree them to a fine paste without adding water.</li>
      <p></p>
      <h3>How to make mushroom masala gravy</h3>
      <p></p>
      <li>
        Heat a pan with 2 tbsp oil. I have added a small piece of bay leaf, 2
        green cardamoms and 1 small cinnamon stick. All of these are optional
        and you may skip them
      </li>
      <li>When the oil becomes slightly hot and spices begin to sizzle, pour the onion tomato puree. Be careful the mixture may begin to splash. Cover partially and continue to cook until the mixture thickens. While this cooks, rinse and slice mushrooms.</li>
      <li>Add ½ to ¾ teaspoon red chili powder, ¾ teaspoon garam masala and ¾ to 1 teaspoon coriander powder (optional).</li>
      <li>Sauté until the mixture turns aromatic and begins to leave the sides. You may not see oil separated as we did not use much here. </li>
      <li>Add 200 grams sliced mushrooms and then sprinkle salt. </li>
      <li>Saute for 2 mins.</li>
      <li>Add ½ to ¾ cup water to make a thick gravy. Adjust the quantity of water slightly as it depends on how much moisture the mushrooms release</li>
      <li>Cover and cook until the gravy thickens and mushrooms are just cooked. Do not overcook as they turn soggy. Sprinkle ½ teaspoon kasuri methi &amp: mix. Taste test and add more salt if needed. At this stage you can also add few tbsps of cream if you like. Cover and turn off the stove.</li>
      <li>Serve mushroom gravy hot with rice, roti or jeera rice.</li>

    <h3>Pro Tips</h3>
     <ol>
    <li>Onions are boiled to remove the raw and bitter taste. Also boiled onion paste gets cooked faster in the pot. Some kind of onions taste bitter when pureed without boiling. You can skip this step if you don&rsquo:t experience that. Alternately you may soak onions in a bowl of water for 15 to 20 mins &amp: then blend them.
        If you do not prefer to grind the onions, simply fine chop them and saute first until golden. Then add the tomato, ginger, garlic and cashew puree.</li>
    <li>Cashews are used to give a creamy texture and milky aroma to the curry. You can substitute them with almonds. Simply soak almonds in hot water for 30 to 60 minutes and peel the skin.</li>
    <li>Mushrooms - White button mushrooms or cremini mushrooms go well in this recipe. Rinse them quickly and do not let them soak up in water for long time. Rinse and slice them only when you are ready to add them in the hot pan.</li>
